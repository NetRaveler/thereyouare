            <p> Here I am. My name is Naheem Maldonado, and I write this despite not being a writer of any sort. I consider myself a simple man of many pleasures and hobbies. My life mission is to help better humanity and our world. I do this out of a sense
                of self preservation and a longing for a brighter future. I do this so that future generations of my family and other families will have the same experiences that I enjoyed. To run amongst the rocks and the trees before the streams, the
                beaches, and mountains.

                Essitially I am a fighter forged from necessity. I learned young and grew it into a passion into adolescents. Along the way I learned from my mother and father, who, between them, held many titles and life experiences. My father is a boat captain, electrician,
                carpenter, and general handyman. My mother a healer, counselor, chef, and mechanic. In my teen to adult years I worked as a handyman, deckhand, etc. I've never felt limited to be one thing.

            <p>I joined the army around 20 years old and spent three years as AUS army bridge engineer, otherwise known as a 12 Charlie. My purpose for the next five years is to create a movement to halt pollution and environmental destruction. Come with
                me on my journey as I develope further as a person personaly and professionaly and push forward with my movement to help humanity.</p>
